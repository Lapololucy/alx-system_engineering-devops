Network software is an umbrella term used to describe a wide range of software that streamlines the operations, design, monitoring, and implementation of computer networks.

One way to categorize the different types of computer network designs is by the scope or scale of the network. For historical reasons, the networking industry refers to nearly every type of design as some type of area network.
Types of Area Networks
Common types of area networks are:

LAN: Local Area Network
WAN: Wide Area Network
WLAN: Wireless Local Area Network
MAN: Metropolitan Area Network
SAN: Storage Area Network, System Area Network, Server Area Network, or sometimes Small Area Network
CAN: Campus Area Network, Controller Area Network, or sometimes Cluster Area Network
PAN: Personal Area Network
LAN and WAN are the two primary and best-known categories of area networks, while the others have emerged with technology advances.
