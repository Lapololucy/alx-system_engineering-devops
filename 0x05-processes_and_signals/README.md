A process can be thought of as an instance of a program in execution. We called this an ‘instance of a program’, because if the same program is run lets say 10 times then there will be 10 corresponding processes.

Moving ahead, each process has its own unique process ID through which it is identified in the system. Besides it own ID, a parent’s process ID is also associated with a process.

A signal is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action.

A signal is just like an interrupt; when it is generated at the user level, a call is made to the kernel of the OS, which then acts accordingly.
