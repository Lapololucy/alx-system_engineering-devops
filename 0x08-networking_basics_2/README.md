The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that 'provides a common basis for the coordination of [ISO] standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection'.[2] In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing system are split into seven different abstraction layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.[3]

The model partitions the flow of data in a communication system into seven abstraction layers to describe networked communication from the physical implementation of transmitting bits across a communications medium to the highest-level representation of data of a distributed application. Each intermediate layer serves a class of functionality to the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. Classes of functionality are realized in all software development through all and any standardized communication protocols.
Localhost is the hostname or the computer that is currently in use to run a program, in which the computer has the role as a virtual server. In web development, you can develop a server by editing the code in the localhost and exporting your data to the server.
