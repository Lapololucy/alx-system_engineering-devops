Outage Incident - Widget Wonder


Issue Summary: 
Duration: 4 hours (June 1, 2023, 09:00 AM - 01:00 PM, UTC-5) Impact: The Widget Wonder service experienced a complete outage, rendering the widgets unavailable for all users. 100% of users were affected, leading to a significant disruption in widget-related activities.
Timeline:
09:00 AM: The issue was detected when monitoring alerts indicated a sudden drop in server response time.
Actions taken: The engineering team investigated the system's components, focusing on the widget rendering service and the underlying data sources. Assumptions were made that the issue might be related to a recent update.
Misleading paths: Initial investigation efforts were mistakenly directed toward the widget rendering service, resulting in wasted time and effort.
09:30 AM: The incident was escalated to the backend infrastructure team for further investigation.

Actions taken: The backend team started examining the data sources and network connections, suspecting a potential issue with the database connectivity.
Misleading paths: An extensive review of the database connections consumed additional time, only to find no abnormalities.
11:00 AM: The incident was escalated to senior management due to the prolonged outage and lack of progress.
Actions taken: Senior management initiated a cross-functional collaboration among the engineering, infrastructure, and database teams to expedite the resolution.
12:00 PM: The incident was resolved as the root cause was identified and addressed.
Resolution: It was discovered that a rogue squirrel had chewed through the main power cable, causing a complete power outage in the data center. The power cable was repaired, and systems were brought back online.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root cause: The outage was caused by a rogue squirrel damaging the main power cable in the data center, resulting in a complete loss of power.

Resolution: The power cable was promptly repaired, and necessary measures were taken to ensure wildlife mitigation around the data center premises.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvement Opportunities:
Implement redundant power sources and backup generators to minimize the impact of power failures.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to promptly detect unusual power fluctuations or outages.
Establish wildlife control measures, such as installing barriers or deterrents, to prevent animal-related incidents in the future.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of the data center's power infrastructure and implement necessary upgrades.
Enhance monitoring systems to include real-time alerts for power disruptions.
Develop and implement a wildlife control plan, including physical deterrents and regular inspections of the premises.
Conclusion: The Widget Wonder service outage was an unexpected incident caused by a mischievous squirrel. Despite initially focusing on the wrong areas during the investigation, cross-functional collaboration and quick escalation led to the identification and resolution of the root cause. The incident highlighted the need for preventive measures, such as redundant power sources and wildlife control, to ensure the service's reliability in the future.
Remember, even in the world of technology, nature can occasionally conspire against us!
