What Is a Network Sniffer?
Both admins and hackers can use packet sniffing apps

Network sniffing is the use of a software tool, called a network sniffer, that monitors or sniffs the data flowing over computer network links in real-time. This software tool is either a self-contained software program or a hardware device with the appropriate software or firmware.

What Is a Network Sniffer?
Network sniffers take snapshot copies of the data flowing over a network without redirecting or altering it. Some sniffers work only with TCP/IP packets, but the more sophisticated tools work with many other network protocols and at lower levels, including Ethernet frames.

Years ago, sniffers were tools used exclusively by professional network engineers. Nowadays, however, with software available for free on the web, they are also popular with internet hackers and people who are curious about networking.

Network sniffers are sometimes referred to as network probes, wireless sniffers, Ethernet sniffers, packet sniffers, packet analyzers, or simply snoops.
How Packet Analyzers Are Used
There's a wide range of applications for packet sniffers. Most packet sniffers can be used inappropriately by one person and for legitimate reasons by another.

A program that captures passwords, for example, could be used by a hacker, but the same tool might be used by a network administrator to find network statistics like available bandwidth.

Network sniffing is also used to test firewall or web filters, and to troubleshoot client/server relationships.

How Network Sniffing Works
A packet sniffer connected to any network intercepts all data flowing over that network.

On an local area network (LAN), computers typically communicate directly with other computers or devices on the network. Anything connected to that network is exposed to all of that traffic. Computers are programmed to ignore all network traffic not intended for it.
